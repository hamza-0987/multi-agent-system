## 🔧 What's Working

### ✅ Core MCP Integration
- MCP server configurations loaded successfully
- Tool functions created and accessible
- Multi-agent system initialized with MCP support

### ✅ File Operations (Perfect)
- **read_file(path)** - Reading files from workspace ✅
- **write_file(path, content)** - Writing files to workspace ✅  
- **list_files(directory)** - Listing workspace contents ✅
- Advanced file operations with nested directories ✅

### ✅ GitHub Integration (API Level)
- GitHub token authentication successful ✅
- User: `hamza-0987` with 45 public repositories ✅
- GitHub search API working (found 804 repositories) ✅
- Direct API access functional ✅

### ✅ Multi-Agent System
- Research team: 4 agents (Researcher, Analyst, TechnicalExpert, Coordinator) ✅
- Development team: 4 agents (Developer, Architect, Tester, DevOps) ✅
- All agents have access to MCP tools ✅
- System ready for collaborative tasks ✅

### ✅ Available MCP Tools for Agents
1. `read_file(file_path)` - Read files from workspace
2. `write_file(file_path, content)` - Write content to files  
3. `list_files(directory)` - List files in directories
4. `github_search(query)` - Search GitHub repositories*
5. `github_list_repos(username)` - List GitHub repositories*
6. `github_get_file(repo, file_path, branch)` - Get file contents from GitHub*

*Note: GitHub MCP server tools have a minor authentication configuration issue, but the underlying API access works.

## 🚀 What You Can Do Now

### 1. **Run Multi-Agent Tasks**
```bash
uv run python multi_agent_system.py
```

### 2. **Start AutoGen Studio Web Interface**
```bash
uv run autogenstudio ui --host localhost --port 8081
```

### 3. **Use Your Agents for Real Tasks**
Your agents can now:
- Collaborate on research projects
- Create and manage files
- Work with external data sources
- Access GitHub repositories (when MCP server auth is fixed)

## 🔧 Minor Issue to Fix

### GitHub MCP Server Authentication
- **Issue**: MCP GitHub server not using token correctly
- **Workaround**: Direct GitHub API access works perfectly
- **Impact**: Low - core MCP functionality is working

### How to Fix:
1. Check MCP GitHub server installation: `npm list -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-github`
2. Verify token scopes include `repo` and `read:user`
3. Restart MCP servers if needed

## 🎯 Conclusion
